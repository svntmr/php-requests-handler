# Requests handler
## Description
This docker-compose service can handle requests via PHP embedded web server with NGINX-based load balancer, store it to the PostgreSQL database and show requests list on the main page
## Useful commands:
1. `docker-compose up -d app` - **run services**
1. `docker-compose up --scale app={amount} -d` - **if you want to create more instances of app, use this command**
1. `docker-compose up client` - **if you want to check database contents** 
1. `docker-compose stop` - **if you want to stop all services** 

### After this you can reach application on http://localhost:8000/
